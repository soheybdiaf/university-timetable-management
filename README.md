## 🧠 Smart Scheduling Logic

* 📅 **All-in-One Booking**
  Each reservation includes professor, room, and group—ensuring all dependencies are accounted for.

* 🛑 **Conflict Prevention**
  The system automatically verifies time availability for each resource before confirming any booking.

* 🎯 **Dynamic Filtering**
  Already-booked resources are dynamically excluded from selection lists.

* ⛔ **No Partial Reservations**
  A course cannot be scheduled without selecting all associated resources.

* Reduce administrative workload and minimize human error.
* Ensure fair and conflict-free resource allocation.
* Offer tailored user experiences based on access roles.
* Enhance usability for all stakeholders: students, professors, and administrators.
